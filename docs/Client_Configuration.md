# Client Configuration

The RemoteRelay client is configured using the `ClientConfig.json` file. This file defines the server connection details and controls which inputs and outputs are visible in the user interface.

## Configuration File Location

- **Development**: `RemoteRelay/ServerDetails.json` (legacy) or `ClientConfig.json`
- **Installed**: Same directory as the `RemoteRelay` executable, named `ClientConfig.json`

## Configuration File Format

```json
{
  "Host": "localhost",
  "Port": 33101,
  "ShownInputs": [
    "Input 1",
    "Input 2"
  ],
  "ShownOutputs": [
    "Output 1",
    "Output 2"
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Properties

### Host (Required)

The IP address or hostname of the RemoteRelay server.

```json
"Host": "192.168.1.100"
```

**Examples:**
- `"localhost"` - Connect to server on the same machine
- `"192.168.1.100"` - Connect to server at specific IP address
- `"relay.example.com"` - Connect using hostname/domain
- `"10.0.0.5"` - Connect to server on local network

### Port (Required)

The TCP port the server is listening on. This must match the `ServerPort` setting in the server's configuration.

```json
"Port": 33101
```

- Default: `33101`
- Must match the server's `ServerPort` configuration
- Valid range: 1-65535

### ShownInputs (Optional)

An array of input source names to display in the client UI. Only sources listed here will be visible to the user.

```json
"ShownInputs": [
  "Input 1",
  "Input 2",
  "Input 3"
]
```

**Behavior:**
- If present: Only the specified sources are shown in the UI
- If omitted or `null`: All sources defined on the server are shown
- Source names must exactly match those defined in the server's `Routes` configuration
- Useful for creating multiple clients with different access levels

**Use Cases:**
- **Operator Interface**: Show only the sources that operator needs to access
- **Department-Specific**: Each department sees only their relevant sources

### ShownOutputs (Optional)

An array of output names to display in the client UI. Only outputs listed here will be visible to the user.

```json
"ShownOutputs": [
  "Output 1",
  "Output 2"
]
```

**Behavior:**
- If present: Only the specified outputs are shown in the UI (multi-output mode)
- If omitted or `null`: All outputs defined on the server are shown
- Output names must exactly match those defined in the server's `Routes` configuration
- When only one output is visible, the client operates in single-output mode

**UI Modes:**
- **Single Output Mode**: If only one output is shown (or ShownOutputs has one item), displays simplified UI with large buttons
- **Multi Output Mode**: If multiple outputs are shown, displays each output as a separate section with its own source buttons

## Example Configurations

### Simple Client (Single Output)

Connect to a server and show all available sources for a single output:

```json
{
  "Host": "192.168.1.50",
  "Port": 33101
}
```

### Filtered Client (Specific Sources)

Show only specific sources that a particular user should access:

```json
{
  "Host": "192.168.1.50",
  "Port": 33101,
  "ShownInputs": [
    "Studio A",
    "Studio B"
  ]
}
```

This configuration would hide other sources (like "Backup" or "Emergency") from the user.

### Multi-Output Client

Display a specific set of sources and outputs:

```json
{
  "Host": "192.168.1.50",
  "Port": 33101,
  "ShownInputs": [
    "Mic 1",
    "Mic 2",
    "Playback"
  ],
  "ShownOutputs": [
    "Stage PA",
    "Monitor Mix",
    "Recording"
  ]
}
```

### Single Output Mode (Explicit)

Force single-output mode by showing only one output:

```json
{
  "Host": "192.168.1.50",
  "Port": 33101,
  "ShownInputs": [
    "Studio A",
    "Studio B",
    "Automation"
  ],
  "ShownOutputs": [
    "Transmitter"
  ]
}
```

This displays a simplified UI optimized for switching a single output between multiple sources.

## Legacy Configuration Format

Older versions used a simpler `ServerDetails.json` format that only specified connection details:

```json
{
  "Host": "localhost",
  "Port": 33101
}
```

This format is still supported but doesn't allow filtering of inputs/outputs. The client will automatically detect which format is being used.

## Connection Behavior

- The client will attempt to connect to the server on startup
- If the connection fails, it will show a connection error and retry automatically
- When the connection is established, the client downloads the current relay state
- Changes made on any client (or via physical buttons) are synchronized to all connected clients in real-time
- If the server goes offline, clients will show a disconnected state and attempt to reconnect

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect to Server

**Check the following:**
1. Verify the `Host` IP address is correct
2. Ensure the `Port` matches the server's `ServerPort` setting
3. Check that the server is running
4. Verify firewall rules allow connections on the specified port
5. Test connectivity with `ping` or `telnet` to the server

### Sources Not Appearing

**Possible causes:**
1. `ShownInputs` array doesn't include the source names exactly as defined on the server
2. Source names are case-sensitive - "Input 1" ≠ "input 1"
3. Server's `Routes` configuration doesn't include those sources

### UI Shows Wrong Mode

**Mode Selection:**
- **Single Output Mode**: Appears when only one output is visible (either by having one output defined on server, or `ShownOutputs` containing one item)
- **Multi Output Mode**: Appears when multiple outputs are visible

Check your `ShownOutputs` configuration to control which mode is used.

## Multiple Client Configurations

You can create multiple configuration files for different users or purposes:

**Operator Client** (`ClientConfig.json`):
```json
{
  "Host": "192.168.1.50",
  "Port": 33101,
  "ShownInputs": ["Studio A", "Studio B", "Automation"]
}
```

**Engineering Client** (`ClientConfig-Engineering.json`):
```json
{
  "Host": "192.168.1.50",
  "Port": 33101
}
```
(Shows all sources and outputs for full control)

To use alternate configurations, rename or copy the desired config file to `ClientConfig.json` before launching the client.
